This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error in array handling. The program intends to populate an array and print its elements. However, due to an error in the loop condition, it attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution demonstrates how to correct the loop condition to avoid this error.
